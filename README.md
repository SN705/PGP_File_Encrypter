# PGP_File_Encrypter
This script encrypts files with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) using the GnuPG library.

PGP Encryption Script:

This script encrypts files located in a specified unencrypted directory using the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption method.
It utilizes the GnuPG library to perform encryption, with the recipient identified by their email address associated with the public key.
The script iterates through each file in the unencrypted directory, encrypts the file content, and saves the encrypted data in a separate directory.
Error handling ensures proper file overwrites, and the script concludes by displaying the encryption status.
